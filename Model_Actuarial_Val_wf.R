## Inputs and Initialization ####
# Currently only initial workforce is defined in this section. 
# Need a complete list of initial inputs:
 # Initial workforce
 # Decrement table
 # vesting policy
 # growth of workforce(controlled by growth rate or pre-defined path of growth.)


## A 3D array is created for each of the 6 status:
#  (1)Active
#  (2)Terminated, vested
#  (3)Terminated, non-vested
#  (4)Disabled
#  (5)Retired
#  (6)Dead

# Retired can be further divided into 3 types by source this feature will be add in future versions
#  (5)-1 Retired from active 
#  (5)-2 Retired from teriminated, vested
#  (5)-3 Retired from disabled


## Setting range of age/entry age, and number of years to be simulated.
 #  These parameters are defined in Model_Actuarial_Val.R
   range_ea    # all possible entry ages  
   range_age   # range of age
   nyear      # number of years in simulation


## In each 3D array, dimension 1(row) represents entry age, dimension 2(column) represents attained age,
# dimension 3(depth) represents number of year.

# For convenience, first define a function that can fill cells in a 3D arrary.

  # This function fill cells in a workforce array.

## Transition matrices ####

# Later we may allow the actual decrement rates to differ from the assumed rates.

  # qx: character, name of the transition probability to be created.
  # df: data frame, decrement table.
  # returns:
  # a transtion matrix

  dimnames(df) <- wf_dimnames[c(1,2)] 
  return(df)
}

# The transition matrices are defined below. The probabilities (eg. qxr for retirement) of flowing
# from the current status to the target status for a cell(age and ea combo) are given in the corresponding
# cell in the transtition matrices. 

# Where do the active go

# (if we wanted to track the flow in each period, we create flow arrays instead of flow matrices)

# Define the shifting matrix. When left mutiplied by a workforce matrix, it shifts each element one cell rightward(i.e. age + 1)
